OpenDreamKit is a
[Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/)
European [Research Infrastructure](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/european-research-infrastructures-including-e-infrastructures)
project that will run for four years, starting from September 2015. It
will provide substantial funding to the open source computational
mathematics ecosystem, and in particular popular tools such as
[LinBox](http://linalg.org/),
[MPIR](http://mpir.org),
[SageMath](http://sagemath.org/),
[GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/),
[Pari/GP](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/),
[LMFDB](http://lmfdb.org/),
[Singular](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/),
[MathHub](https://mathhub.info/),
and the
[IPython/Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) interactive computing
environment.

From this ecosystem, OpenDreamKit will deliver a flexible toolkit
enabling research groups to set up
[Virtual Research Environments](http://www.2020-horizon.com/e-Infrastructures-for-virtual-research-environments-%28VRE%29-i1490.html),
customised to meet the varied needs of research projects in pure
mathematics and applications, and supporting the full research
life-cycle from exploration, through proof and publication, to
archival and sharing of data and code.

Altogether the project involves about 50 people spread over 15 sites
in Europe, with a total budget of about 7.6 million euros. The largest
portion of that will be devoted to employing an average of 11
researchers and developers working full time on the
project. Additionally, the participants will contribute the equivalent
of six other people working full time.

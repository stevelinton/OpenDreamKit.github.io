## Brainstorm about Sphinx in Sage

## Brainstorm about structured documents

Logilab, Min, Florent, ... Friday

## Brainstorm about 3D Visualization

Time: Thursday late afternoon

Logilab, University of Silesia, 

 - USilesia, starts building a javascript library for static and dynamic (i.e. communication with python objects as ipywidgets do) data visualization in the Jupyter notebook. The project will deliver a first version in December 2015. It will be based on threejs.  
 - in the meantime there will be technology review done (Logilab) for alternative rendering solution. We mentioned using webgl natively, vispy, and paraview.

## Continuous integration, building on various architecture, joint testing farm

Time: Thursday afternoon's break

Jeroen, Alexander, Jean-Pierre

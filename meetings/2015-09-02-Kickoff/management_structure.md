# Coordinator deputy

It was decided to have a coordinator deputy that would be kept

# Advisory board / End User Group

Chair?

Meets at least once a year

It was felt that there was some redundancy with those two body which
would impose unnecessary management work (meeting organisation,
...). It was decided to slightly modify the management structure by
having only one advisory board composed of 6 to 8 people, some of
which would be end users. The end user group will be replaced by an
informal community, modelled by a public and open mailing list.

Names were suggested for the advisory board.

## Quality Review Board

Get noticed whenever a deliverable is submitted.

Meet before the regular reports

Hans Fanghor was nominated to chair the Quality Review Board.

Composition: as planned

# Voting rules

It was decided upon the following voting rules

- ``Easy questions'': 2/3 of represented members, with quorum = 2/3 of the whole set of members
- ``Hard questions'': 3/4 of represented members, with quorum = 3/4 of the whole set of members

Electronic vote are allowed, typically using adoodle.org

Definition of hard questions:

- Large changes to the budget (>= 100k euros?)
- Evolution to the consortium (as listed on the slide)
- Firing the coordinator
- Resolving ambiguity about whether something is a hard question

Everything else -- including choosing a new coordinator in case of
uncapacity -- is considered ``easy''.

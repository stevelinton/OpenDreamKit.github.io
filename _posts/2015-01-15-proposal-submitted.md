title: Proposal submitted

The OpenDreamKit proposal was submitted on January 15th of 2015.
It was written collaboratively by a diverse team
across Europe and science. Have fun watching this
[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM9zcfRtOqo), produced with
[Gource](https://code.google.com/p/gource/), of the activity on our
collaborative work space on github. A pretty good illustration --
especially during the final sprint -- of how a dispersed but dedicated
team can collaborate efficiently with modern tools!

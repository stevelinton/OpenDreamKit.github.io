title: Full-time developer position opening at Université de Bordeaux for Fall 2015
---

This is an announcement for a full-time developer ([Ingénieur de
Recherche](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ing%C3%A9nieur_de_recherche))
position opening at Université de Bordeaux, working on open source
software engineering for computational mathematics.

contact: vincent.delecroix-AT-labri.fr

# Duration

For 4 years starting in Fall 2015. Interviews will be run
in September.

# Salary

Depending on the applicant's past experience, 1600 € to 2300 €
of monthly *salaire net* (salary after non-wage labour cost but before
income tax). Equivalently, this is a yearly *salaire brut* of
23600 € to 34999 €.

# Location

The developer will work at the
[LaBRI](http://labri.fr) in the Talence campus, 10 minutes
from Bordeaux city center by public transport.

# Mission

To support the maintenance and development of the OpenDreamKit
components, and in particular of the [SageMath](http://sagemath.org) and
[PARI/GP](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/) projects.

# Activities

According to his or her specific skills, the developer will take on, in close
collaboration with the community, a selection of the software engineering tasks
defined in the OpenDreamKit project. Among these:

- Improve the existing software components (code optimisation and
  parallelisation);

- Improve communication between the software components;

- Improve the graphic interfaces;

- Participate actively in regular European development and training meetings
  with the other OpenDreamKit participants.

# Skills and background required

- Development in Unix-like environments;

- Experience with code optimisation, parallelism (pthread, OpenMP, MPI),
  debugging (valgrind, gdb);

- Fluency in several of C, C++, Python, Cython, assemblers;

- Fluency in English;

The following are not prerequisites but would be very much appreciated:

- Experience in open-source development (collaborative
  development tools, interaction with the community, ...);

- Experience with computational mathematics software, in particular
  [SageMath](http://sagemath.org) or [PARI/GP](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/);

- Mathematics background.

# Applications

Applicants should send an email to vincent-DOT-delecroix-AT-labri-DOT-fr with:

- A complete CV

- A motivation letter

Both documents must be in an open format (pdf, ps, plain text, ...) either in
french or english.

# Context

The position will be funded by

[OpenDreamKit](http://opendreamkit.org), a
[Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/)
European [Research Infrastructure](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/european-research-infrastructures-including-e-infrastructures)
project that will run for four years, starting from September
2015. This project brings together the open-source computational
mathematics ecosystem -- and in particular
[LinBox](http://linalg.org/),
[MPIR](http://mpir.org),
[SageMath](http://sagemath.org/),
[GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/),
[Pari/GP](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/),
[LMFDB](http://lmfdb.org/),
[Singular](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/),
[MathHub](https://mathhub.info/),
and the
[IPython/Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) interactive computing
environment.
-- toward building a
flexible toolkit for
[Virtual Research Environments](http://www.2020-horizon.com/e-Infrastructures-for-virtual-research-environments-%28VRE%29-i1490.html)
for mathematics. Led by Université Paris-Sud, this project involves
about 50 people spread over 15 sites in Europe, with a total budget of
about 7.6 million euros.

The developer will work within one of the largest teams of SageMath
and PARI/GP developers, composed essentially of researchers in
mathematics and computer science, at the [Laboratoire Bordelais de Recherche en
Informatique](http://www.labri.fr/) and in nearby institutions
such as the [Institut de Mathématiques de Bordeaux](http://www.math.u-bordeaux1.fr/imb/spip.php)
and [INRIA Bordeaux](https://www.inria.fr/centre/bordeaux).


# Comments

:warning: This is *not* a postdoc position. While side research will
be welcome, and a few tasks may possibly lead to some research
problems in computer science, the core tasks will be pure
development. Candidates wishing to pursue an academic research career
in the long run should consider twice whether this opportunity is
adequate for them.

title: Full-time developer position opening at Université Paris-Sud for Fall 2015 (filled)
---

This is an announcement for a full-time developer ([Ingénieur de
Recherche](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ing%C3%A9nieur_de_recherche))
position opening at Université Paris-Sud, working on open source
software engineering for computational mathematics.

# Time line

For now we hope to run interviews in early July, for a recruitment in
early Fall 2015, and for up to four years (presumably in the form of a
one year contract, renewable three times).

A second full-time developer will be hired later on, presumably in Fall 2016.

# Salary

Depending on the applicant's past experience, between 2000€ and 3000€
of monthly "salaire net" (salary after non-wage labour cost but before
income tax). Equivalently, this is a "salaire brut" of up to 46200€
yearly, or a "salaire brut chargé" (total cost for the project) of up
to 5500€ monthly.

# Location

The developer will work at the
[Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique](http://www.lri.fr) of
[Université Paris Sud](http://www.u-psud.fr), in the
Orsay-Bures-Gif-Saclay campus, 25 km South-West of Paris city centre.

# Mission

To support the maintenance and development of the
[OpenDreamKit](http://opendreamkit.org) components, and in particular
of the [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org) project, by enhancing their
software infrastructure, in close collaboration with the community.

# Activities

A successful candidate will be expected to do significant progress, in
close collaboration with the community, on some of the engineering
tasks defined in the [OpenDreamKit](http://opendreamkit.org)
project. Among these:

- Improve the build, packaging, test, and distribution infrastructure;

- Improve the portability of many of the components, in particular on
  the Windows+Cygwin platform;

- Refactor the static Sphinx-based documentation system, and
  design and develop dynamic documentation tools;

- Participate in designing and implementing a component architecture
  for the SageMath ecosystem, as a foundation for Virtual Research
  Environments such as SageMathCloud;

- Participate actively in regular international development and
  training meetings with the other OpenDreamKit participants and the
  community at large.

For details, see the technical task lead by UPSud and UVSQ in
Section 3.1.6 ``Workpackage Description'' of the
[OpenDreamKit Proposal](https://github.com/OpenDreamKit/OpenDreamKit/raw/master/Proposal/proposal-www.pdf).


# Skills and background requirements

- Fluency in C, C++, Python, ...

- Strong experience with development and system administration in
  Unix-like environments;

- Experience with Windows development (Cygwin) desirable;

- Strong experience with software build systems (e.g. scons, cmake, or automake);

- Strong experience in open-source development (collaborative
  development tools, interaction with the community, ...);

- Experience with code optimization, parallelism, etc, appreciated but
  not a prerequisite.

- Experience with computational mathematics software, in particular
  [SageMath](http://sagemath.org), desirable but not a prerequisite;

- Mathematics background and/or holding a PhD appreciated but not a
  prerequisite;

- Strong communication skills;

- Perfect fluency in oral and written English;

- Speaking French is appreciated but not a prerequisite.

# Context

The position will be funded by

[OpenDreamKit](http://opendreamkit.org), a
[Horizon 2020](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/)
European [Research Infrastructure](https://ec.europa.eu/programmes/horizon2020/en/h2020-section/european-research-infrastructures-including-e-infrastructures)
project that will run for four years, starting from September
2015. This project brings together the open-source computational
mathematics ecosystem -- and in particular
[LinBox](http://linalg.org/),
[MPIR](http://mpir.org),
[SageMath](http://sagemath.org/),
[GAP](http://www.gap-system.org/),
[Pari/GP](http://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/),
[LMFDB](http://lmfdb.org/),
[Singular](http://www.singular.uni-kl.de/),
[MathHub](https://mathhub.info/),
and the
[IPython/Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) interactive computing
environment.
-- toward building a
flexible toolkit for
[Virtual Research Environments](http://www.2020-horizon.com/e-Infrastructures-for-virtual-research-environments-%28VRE%29-i1490.html)
for mathematics. Lead by Université Paris-Sud, this project involves
about 50 people spread over 15 sites in Europe, with a total budget of
about 7.6 million euros.

Within this ecosystem, the developer will work primarily on the free
open-source mathematics software system
[Sagemath](http://sagemath.org). Based on the
[Python](http://www.python.org) language and many existing open-source
math libraries, SageMath is developed since 10 years by a worldwide
community of 300 researchers, teachers and engineers, and has reached
1.5M lines of code.

The developer will work within one of the largest teams of SageMath
developers, composed essentially of researchers in mathematics and
computer science, at the [Laboratoire de Recherche en
Informatique](http://www.lri.fr/) and in nearby institutions.


# Comments

:warning: This is *not* a postdoc position. While side research will
be welcome, and a few tasks may possibly lead to some research
problems in computer science, the core tasks will be pure
development. Candidates wishing to pursue an academic research career
in the long run should consider twice whether this opportunity is
adequate for them.

# Applications

To apply for this position, please send an e-mail to
upsud-recruitment-research-engineer at opendreamkit.org before July
1st, with the following documents attached:

- cover_letter.pdf: a cover letter, in English (why are you interested in this particular position);

- CV.pdf: a CV, highlighting among other things your skills and
  background and your contributions to open source software;

- phd_reports.pdf: PhD reports (when applicable);

- reference letters (each named reference_letter_<contactname>.pdf),
  or alternatively reference contact information.

Applications sent after July 1st will be considered until the position
is filled.
